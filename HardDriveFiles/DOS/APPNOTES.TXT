1. MAKING YOUR SOFTWARE COMPATIBLE WITH DOS 5.O
==================================================

1.1 Aboveboard 286 and Aboveboard Plus Installation Programs
------------------------------------------------------------
CAUTION: The Intel Aboveboard installation program tests
memory in a way that corrupts extended memory.

Before using Intel's Aboveboard installation program, make sure
you haven't loaded software such as SMARTDRV or RAMDRIVE that
uses extended memory.

1.2 AUTORUN.EXE
---------------
If you can't use Mountain Network Solutions AUTORUN.EXE, a tape-
drive backup program, contact your vendor for an upgrade.

1.3 CodeView
------------
CAUTION: Using versions 3.0 to 3.13 of the CodeView CV.EXE file
may cause the loss of data if your system has a 80386 memory
manager (such as EMM386.EXE) and device drivers or programs that
use extended memory.

To start CodeView versions 3.0 to 3.13 safely, use the CV.COM
file included with DOS 5.0.

Copy the CV.COM file from the distribution disks to the directory
that contains your CV.EXE file. Then, type the following to start
CodeView:

   CV

   or

   CV.COM

If you start CodeView by using a batch file or program item in a
shell (such as DOS Shell), change the batch file or program
item so that it specifies the CV.COM instead of the CV.EXE file.

Make sure you use HIMEM.SYS driver version 2.77 or later with
CodeView. Otherwise, the CV.COM file will not prevent data loss.
DOS 5.0 includes version 2.77.

This problem has been fixed in CodeView version 3.14. Call
Microsoft Customer Service to get this version.

1.4 Easel 6.0
-------------
Interactive Images Easel 6.0 is incompatible with the DOS=HIGH and
EMM386 commands. Contact your vendor for an update.

1.5 Fastback
------------
If you run DOS 5.0 in the high memory area, you must use the
LOADFIX command before running Fifth Generation Systems Fastback
or the Fastback installation program. Type the following:

    LOADFIX fb.exe

    or

    LOADFIX fbinstal.exe

For information about the LOADFIX command, see Chapter 4 of the
IBM DOS Getting Started guide.

1.6 GeoWorks
------------
If you cannot run GeoWorks (PC/GEOS) after installing DOS
5.0, use the SETVER command to report version number 4.01 to the
GEOS.EXE file.

Do not run the installation program for GeoWorks Ensemble when
DOS Shell Task Swapper is active.

Use the Exclusive Tasking option when running GeoWorks Ensemble
with Windows, and use the Prevent Program Switch option when
running it with DOS Shell Task Swapper.

1.7 Keyboard Conflicts
----------------------
Some software packages do not support the extended ROM BIOS for
101/102-key keyboards.  These include Lotus Metro, Lotus Express,
IBM Displaywrite III, Borland Turbo Lightning, and Micro Logic
Tornado 1.8. If you can't use your keyboard after starting an
application, restart your computer, and add the following line
to your CONFIG.SYS file:

   switches=/k

If you are using ANSI.SYS, also add a /k switch to the
DEVICE=ANSI.SYS command in your CONFIG.SYS file.

1.8 Lotus 1-2-3 (3.0 or Later)
------------------------------
If you run Lotus 1-2-3 3.0 with Task Swapper in DOS Shell,
set the XMS Memory KB Required option in the Advanced dialog box
to 384.

For more information about specifying advanced properties, see
Chapter 8 of the IBM DOS User's Guide and Reference.

If you run Lotus 1-2-3 3.0 or later and load device drivers or
memory-resident programs into the upper memory area,
use the RAM switch with the DEVICE=EMM386.EXE command in your
CONFIG.SYS file.

1.9 Manifest
------------
Version 1.0 of Quarterdeck Manifest is incompatible with DOS
5.0. Contact your vendor for an upgrade.

1.10 Paintbrush 2.0
-------------------
If you have an EGA monitor and want to run Microsoft or ZSoft
Paintbrush 2.0, you must remove the DEVICE=EGA.SYS command from
your CONFIG.SYS file. After removing the command, you may
have difficulty with screen swapping when using Task Swapper in
DOS Shell.

1.11 PC-Kwik Disk Accelerator
-----------------------------
Do not load versions of Multisoft PC-Kwik Disk Accelerator
earlier than 2.0 into the upper memory area.

1.12 Pklite
-----------
Do not use Pklite to pack device drivers.

If you have a PC-Kwik cache on your system, and you can't run
a packed program, do one of the following:
   * Use the LOADFIX command to start the program.
   * Run DOS 5.0 in conventional memory.
   * Run a version of the program that was not packed with Pklite.
   * Disable asynchronous reads on the PC-Kwik cache.

For information about the LOADFIX command, see Chapter 4 of the
IBM DOS Getting Started guide.

1.13 ProKey and DOS Editor/QBasic
------------------------------------
Some versions of RoseSoft ProKey are incompatible with DOS
Editor and QBasic.

1.14 Sidekick 2.0
-----------------
If you are running DOS 5.0 in the high memory area, use the
following LOADFIX command to start Borland Sidekick 2.0:

    LOADFIX sk2.exe

For information about the LOADFIX command, see Chapter 4 of the
IBM DOS Getting Started guide.

1.15 Soft-ICE
-------------
When using Nu-Mega Soft-ICE, load it before loading other
drivers. Otherwise, you may lose data stored in extended memory
by drivers such as SMARTDRV.

1.16 Software Carousel
----------------------
Software Carousel 5.0 is incompatible with DOS 5.0.

If you installed HIMEMSLS.SYS, remove the DEVICE=HIMEMSLS.SYS
command from your CONFIG.SYS after running Setup.

To use DOSKEY, load it after loading Software Carousel into
memory.

1.17 Task Swapper and Asynchronous I/O
--------------------------------------
Some programs that perform asynchronous communications are
incompatible with DOS Shell Task Swapper. Terminal-emulation
software (such as SmartCom and Procomm Plus) and server/client
software (such as Laplink and Blast) are asynchronous
communications programs. If you can't use an asynchronous
program, contact your vendor for more information.

1.18 Ventura Publisher
----------------------
If you can't start Ventura Publisher, make sure your Ventura
Publisher directory is within the first 70 characters of the PATH
command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

1.19 WordPerfect WPINFO.EXE 5.1
-------------------------------
Some versions of WordPerfect WPINFO.EXE are incompatible with
DOS 5.0. Contact your vendor for more information.

1.20 WordPerfect Office 3.0
---------------------------
Some versions of WordPerfect Office 3.0 are incompatible with
DOS 5.0. Contact your vendor for more information.

1.21 XTreeNet
-------------
To use XTreeNet with DOS Shell Task Swapper, select the
Prevent Program Switch option in the DOS Shell Advanced
dialog box. For more information about specifying advanced
properties, see Chapter 8 of the IBM DOS User's Guide
and Reference.
